# nvimdev.nvim

Provides some nicities for hacking on [Neovim][]:

- Auto-detect Neovim source tree and `:cd` to the root.
- Fast linting for C sources (clint.py and uncrustify).
  - Uses `vim.diagnostic`
- Filetype settings appropriate for Neovim's source code.
- Hook into [vim-projectionist]: configure alternate files for the ".vim-src"
  directory, and a command to diff against the same file in Vim.
- Add commands `NvimTestRun` and `NvimTestClear` for running functional tests directly in the buffer.


## Why?

Neovim has a pretty large code base and is full of Vim's rich and mysterious
history.  I have little knowledge of either and [wrote a script][gist] to help
me get around and automate some things.  People have shown interest in using
it, so it's now a plugin that will make maintenance easier.

## Installation

ðŸ˜‘

## Requirements

- Python 3
- [plenary.nvim][]

## Config

#### `g:nvimdev_auto_cd` (default `1`)

Automatically `:cd` to the Neovim root after init.

## Commands

`NvimTestRun [all]`: Run the test in the buffer the cursor is inside. Works for `it` and `describe` blocks.

`NvimTestClear`: Clear test result decorations in buffer
